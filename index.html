		<h1>The Seed Project</h1>
		<p>Don't mind this horrible page, i will certainly make a beautiful one when I get the creativity.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3>What is it?</h3>
		<p>This is a project that aims to create a virtual reality platform, much like what (spoiler ahead) Kayaba Akihiko gives to Kirito through the Seed Of The World (that's where the name comes from). </p>
		<p>The project will contain some subprojects: for now, I'm thinking on subprojects for the engine itself, a sample game using it (something like ALO), and the swarm controller app (more details on it later).</p>
		<h3>How?</h3>
		<p>This is an <strong>open source</strong> project, so code from everyone will be welcome (if it actually adds something to the project). </p>
		<p>The engine itself will be written in C++. It should be multiplatform, so our graphical backend will be OpenGL (and possibly Vulkan in the future).</p>
		<p>The swarm controller will be written in JavaScript using Node.js and the game will be in Lua, as the engine will use it as scripting language.</p>
		<p>While most people doesn't own a VR headset, there'll be some systems to provide Cardboard-esque support.</p>
		<h3>Blabla?</h3>
		<p>Blablablabla.</p>
		<h3>License</h3>
		<p>The whole project will be licensed under the GNU LGPL 3 license.</p>
